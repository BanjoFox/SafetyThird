# Dictionary of Kink Terminology

## General Terms ---

*Service (Role)* or *Service-Type*

## Safety Acronyms ---

*SCC* \-- Safe, Sane, Consensual  
**Note:** Currently considered to be deprecated, even by its originator (David Stein), because the phrase has become overly diluted. Some folks would even pose the joke: "Safe, Sane, Consensual; pick two." as a way of hinting that kink-play always carries some form of risk, and cannot (generally), embody all three statements simultaneously. It is also important to note that consent is considered to be a hard requirement at all times.

*RACK \--* Risk Aware Consensual Kink (Coined by Gary Switch, 1999\)  
**Note:** Currently considered to be the most appropriate acronym for kink safety as it reminds participants that they need to be aware of the risks for the activities they choose to participate in.

*PRICK \-- Personal Responsibility Informed Kink*  
**Note**: A lesser known acronym, but one that reinforces the idea that kink participants are ultimately responsible for their own safety.
